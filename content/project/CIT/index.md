This project is funded by the [La Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer - Carte d'Idendit√© de Tumeurs, CIT](http://cit.ligue-cancer.net/language/fr/le-programme-cit/) 

This project is leaded by Dr ALENTORN and aims to analyze PCNSL using multi-comics NGS data:

1. Whole-exome
2. RNA-seq
3. Methylation
4. Radiomics

We will use a large cohort of PCNSL to underpin new potential therapeutic targets in this orphan disease.
