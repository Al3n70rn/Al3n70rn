This project is funded by the Institut National du Cancer [INCa](https://www.e-cancer.fr/) and the [DGOS](https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/ministere/organisation/directions/article/dgos-direction-generale-de-l-offre-de-soins) and aim to model mathematically the evolution of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).

It is a partnership between different teams: 

1. [AP-HP](https://www.aphp.fr/), Pr HOANG-XUAN and Dr ALENTORN
2. [CEA-Neurospin](http://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/Pages/Entites_de_recherche/NeuroSpin.aspx) Dr FROUIN
3. [INRIA from Paris](https://www.inria.fr/equipes/mamba), Dr DRASDO 
4. [INRIA from Bordeaux](https://www.inria.fr/equipes/monc), Dr SAUT and
5. [Institut Curie](https://science.curie.fr/plateformes/radiotherapie-experimentale/), Dr SOUSSAIN

It will combine radiomics data, NGS, and microscopic data from data to model and microscopic and mesoscale the evolution of PCNSL. It addition we will also use a mouse model of PCNSL to further improve our knowledge in this rare disease.
