abstract = "BACKGROUND:Patients with a first episode of longitudinal extensive transverse myelopathy (LETM) were reviewed with two objectives: to evaluate the clinical spectrum of LETM and to analyze the related clinical and laboratory variables that can be used as functional prognostic markers.METHODS:A retrospective review was conducted of clinical, radiologic and biochemical data of patients admitted for LETM between 1993 and 2011.RESULTS:Our cohort included 72 patients [median age 41 years, interquartile range (IQR) 29-61.5]. Median follow-up was 34 months (IQR 17.2-63). The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was ≥2 at the end of follow-up in 72.2%. The final diagnosis was idiopathic LETM in 22 patients, multiple sclerosis in 18, parainfectious disease in 11, systemic disease in 9, spinal cord infarction and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders in 3 patients each, and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, dural fistula, and tumor-related LETM in 2 patients each. Unfavorable outcome was associated with mRS ≥2 at admission [odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.66] and older age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11).CONCLUSION:Idiopathic LETM was the most frequent diagnosis at the end of follow-up. Older age and clinically severe disease at onset were independent prognostic factors of poorer functional recovery."
