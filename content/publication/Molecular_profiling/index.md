abstract = "Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Over the last decade, significant advances have been made in the molecular characterization of this tumor group, identifying predictive biomarkers or molecular actionable targets, and paving the way to molecular-based targeted therapies. This personalized therapeutic approach is effective and illustrated in the present review. Among many molecular abnormalities, BRAF mutation and mTOR activation in pilocytic astrocytomas and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas are actionable targets sensitive to vemurafenib and everolimus, respectively. Chromosome arms 1p/19q co-deletion and IDH mutational status are pivotal in driving delivery of early procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine chemotherapy in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors. Although consensus to assess MGMT promoter methylation is not reached yet, it may be useful in predicting resistance to temozolomide in elderly patients."
