abstract = "Primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL) are rare and poor prognosis diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Because of the brain tumor environment and the restricted distribution of drugs in the CNS, specific PCNSL patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models are needed for preclinical research to improve the prognosis of PCNSL patients. PCNSL patient specimens (n = 6) were grafted in the caudate nucleus of immunodeficient nude mice with a 83% rate of success, while subcutaneous implantation in nude mice of human PCNSL sample did not generate lymphoma, supporting the role of the brain microenvironment in the PCNSL physiopathology. PDOXs showed diffuse infiltration of B-cell lymphoma cells in the brain parenchyma. Each model had a unique mutational signature for genes in the BCR and NF-κB pathways and retained the mutational profile of the primary tumor. The models can be stored as cryopreserved biobank. Human IL-10 levels measured in the plasma of PCNSL-PDOX mice showed to be a reliable tool to monitor the tumor burden. Treatment response could be measured after a short treatment with the targeted therapy ibrutinib. In summary, we established a panel of human PCNSL-PDOX models that capture the histological and molecular characteristics of the disease and that proved suitable for preclinical experiments. Our methods of generation and characterization will enable the generation of additional PDOX-PCNSL models, essential tools for cognitive and preclinical drug discovery."
