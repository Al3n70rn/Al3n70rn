abstract = "TP53 is a pivotal gene frequently mutated in diffuse gliomas and particularly in astrocytic tumors. The majority of studies dedicated to TP53 in gliomas were focused on mutational hotspots located in exons 5-8. Recent studies have suggested that TP53 is also mutated outside the classic mutational hotspots reported in gliomas. Therefore, we have sequenced all TP53 coding exons in a retrospective series of 61 low grade gliomas (LGG) using high throughput sequencing technology. In addition, TP53 mutational status was correlated with: (i) p53 expression, (ii) tumor type, (iii) chromosome arms 1p/19q status and (iv) clinical features of patients. The cohort included 32 oligodendrogliomas (O), 21 oligoastrocytomas (M) and 8 astrocytomas (A). TP53 mutation was detected in 52.4% (32/61) of tumors (34% of O, 71.4% of M and 75% of A). All mutations (38 mutations in 32 samples) were detected in exons 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10. Missense and non-missense mutations, including seven novel mutations, were detected in 42.6 and 9.8% of tumors respectively. TP53 mutations were almost mutually exclusive with 1p/19q co-deletion and were associated with: (i) astrocytic phenotype, (ii) younger age, (iii) p53 expression. Using a threshold of 10% p53-positive tumor cells, p53 expression is an interesting surrogate marker for missense TP53 mutations (Se = 92%; Sp = 79.4%) but not for non-missense mutation (18.4% of mutations). TP53 and p53 statuses were not prognostic in LGG. In conclusion, we have identified novel TP53 mutations in LGG. TP53 mutations outside exons 4-8 are rare. Although it remains imperfect, p53 expression with a threshold of 10% is a good surrogate marker for missense TP53 mutations and appears helpful in the setting of LGG phenotype diagnosis."
