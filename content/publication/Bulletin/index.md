abstract = "Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Despite very intensive treatments (i.e. maximal safe surgery, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy), the prognosis of glioblastoma patients remains dismal with a median overall survival below 2 years. More effective and better tolerated treatments are needed. Over the last years, major advances have been accomplished in the molecular characterization of glioblastoma mainly thanks to high throughput molecular biology techniques. In parallel to these biological advances, pharmacological progresses have been made with the development of molecular targeted therapies or precision medicine or smart drugs targeting these molecular alterations detected in cancer cells but absent in normal cells of the body. These targeted molecular therapies, more effective and less toxic, have already revolutionized the prognosis of several systemic cancers (e.g., melanoma, lung cancer). On the basis of our knowledge of glioblastoma molecular biology, these molecular targeted therapies also appear promising in glioblastomas. Anti-angiogenic drugs are the most advanced molecular targeted therapies in their evaluation. Promising results were observed in recurrent glioblastoma patients. Other molecular targeted therapies are currently under preclinical or clinical evaluations. Similarly, to several systemic cancers, molecular targeted therapies will most likely find quickly their place in the therapeutic arsenal directed against glioblastomas to improve survival and quality of ife of patients suffering from this cancer type."
