# Background

I am a Neuro-oncologist working at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital and at the Institut du Cerveau et la Moelle (ICM). We are working in the analysis of high-dimensional data (next-generation sequencing, GWAS, etc) combined with MRI in different neuro-oncological diseases.

I did my MD and my Neurology residency in Barcelona and I moved to Paris at the end of 2010 to start my PhD on the genetic characterization of low-grade gliomas, under the supervision of Dr Idbaih and Pr Delattre. More recently, I collaborated	with the Brainomics team at Neurospin with a "Poste d'accueil" grant to analyze radiomics data combined with NGS of primary central nervous system lymphomas and brain metastasis.
