Because of the brain tumor environment and the restricted distribution of drugs in the CNS, specific PCNSL patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models are needed for preclinical research to improve the prognosis of PCNSL patients. PCNSL patient specimens (n = 6) were grafted in the caudate nucleus of immunodeficient nude mice with a 83% rate of success, while subcutaneous implantation in nude mice of human PCNSL sample did not generate lymphoma, supporting the role of the brain microenvironment in the PCNSL physiopathology. PDOXs showed diffuse infiltration of B-cell lymphoma cells in the brain parenchyma. Each model had a unique mutational signature for genes in the BCR and NF-κB pathways and retained the mutational profile of the primary tumor. The models can be stored as cryopreserved biobank. Human IL-10 levels measured in the plasma of PCNSL-PDOX mice showed to be a reliable tool to monitor the tumor burden. Treatment response could be measured after a short treatment with the targeted therapy ibrutinib. In summary, we established a panel of human PCNSL-PDOX models that capture the histological and molecular characteristics of the disease and that proved suitable for preclinical experiments. Our methods of generation and characterization will enable the generation of additional PDOX-PCNSL models, essential tools for cognitive and preclinical drug discovery.","tags":[],"title":"Primary CNS lymphoma patient-derived orthotopic xenograft model capture the biological and molecular characteristics of the disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536444000,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Rosenberg S","Ducray F","Alentorn A","Dehais C","Elarouci N","Kamoun A","Marie Y","Tanguy ML","De Reynies A","Mokhtari K","Figarella-Branger D","Delattre JY","Idbaih A","POLA Network"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531778400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531778400,"objectID":"b7862c282d2bb29d2de42eb174e215c5","permalink":"/publication/ml_pola/","publishdate":"2018-07-17T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ml_pola/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:1p/19q-codeleted anaplastic gliomas have variable clinical behavior. We have recently shown that the common 9p21.3 allelic loss is an independent prognostic factor in this tumor type. The aim of this study is to identify less frequent genomic copy number variations (CNVs) with clinical importance that may shed light on molecular oncogenesis of this tumor type.MATERIALS AND METHODS:A cohort of 197 patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma was collected as part of the French POLA network. Clinical, pathological, and molecular information was recorded. CNV analysis was performed using single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Computational biology and feature selection based on the random forests method were used to identify CNV events associated with overall survival and other clinical-pathological variables. RESULTS:Recurrent chromosomal events were identified in chromosomes 4, 9, and 11. Forty-six focal amplification events and 22 focal deletion events were identified. Twenty-four focal CNV areas were associated with survival, and five of them were significantly associated with survival after multivariable analysis. Nine out of 24 CNV events were validated using an external cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Five of the validated events contain a cancer-related gene or microRNA: CDKN2A deletion, SS18L1 amplification, RHOA/MIR191 copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity, FGFR3 amplification, and ARNT amplification. The CNV profile contributes to better survival prediction compared with clinical-based risk assessment.CONCLUSION:Several recurrent CNV events, detected in anaplastic oligodendroglioma, enable better survival prediction. More importantly, they help in identifying potential genes for understanding oncogenesis and for personalized therapy.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:Genomic analysis of 197 anaplastic oligodendroglioma tumors reveals recurrent somatic copy number variation areas that may help in understanding oncogenesis and target identification for precision medicine. A machine learning multivariable model built using this genomic information enables better survival prediction.","tags":[],"title":"Machine Learning for Better Prognostic Stratification and Driver Gene Identification Using Somatic Copy Number Variations in Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruno A","Labreche K","Daniau M","Boisselier B","Gauchotte G","Royer-Perron L","Rahimian A","Lemoine F","de la Grange P","Guégan J","Bielle F","Polivka M","Adam C","Meyronet D","Figarella-Branger D","Villa C","Chrétien F","Eimer S","Davi F","Rousseau A","Houillier C","Soussain C","Mokhtari K","Hoang-Xuan K","Alentorn A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530741600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530741600,"objectID":"aab7a3fb19028ca99d6457ac63628c0b","permalink":"/publication/etv6/","publishdate":"2018-07-05T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/etv6/","section":"publication","summary":"Background:Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) represents a particular entity within non-Hodgkin lymphomas and is associated with poor outcome. The present study addresses the potential clinical relevance of chimeric transcripts in PCNSL discovered by using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).Methods:Seventy-two immunocompetent and newly diagnosed PCNSL cases were included in the present study. Among them, 6 were analyzed by RNA-seq to detect new potential fusion transcripts. We confirmed the results in the remaining 66 PCNSL. The gene fusion was validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. We assessed the biological and clinical impact of one new gene fusion. Results:We identified a novel recurrent gene fusion, E26 transformation-specific translocation variant 6-immunoglobulin heavy chain (ETV6-IgH). Overall, ETV6-IgH was found in 13 out of 72 PCNSL (18%). No fusion conserved an intact functional domain of ETV6, and ETV6 was significantly underexpressed at gene level, suggesting an ETV6 haploinsufficiency mechanism. The presence of the gene fusion was also validated by FISH in FFPE samples. Finally, PCNSL samples harboring ETV6-IgH showed a better prognosis in multivariate analysis, P = 0.03, hazard ratio = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12-0.88. The overall survival at 5 years was 69% for PCNSL harboring ETV6-IgH versus 29% for samples without this gene fusion.Conclusions:ETV6-IgH is a new potential surrogate marker of PCNSL with favorable prognosis with ETV6 haploinsufficiency as a possible mechanism. The potential clinical impact of ETV6-IgH should be validated in larger prospective studies.","tags":[],"title":"Identification of novel recurrent ETV6-IgH fusions in primary central nervous system lymphoma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vialatte de Pémille C","Berzero G","Small M","Psimaras D","Giry M","Daniau M","Sanson M","Delattre JY","Honnorat J","Desestret V","Alentorn A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528927200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528927200,"objectID":"e89698490618849fcad3a41635871602","permalink":"/publication/antiyo/","publishdate":"2018-06-14T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/antiyo/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare conditions where an autoimmune reaction against the nervous system appears in patients suffering from a tumour, but not linked to the spreading of the tumour.

In this context, this study aims to propose some rules to compute reliable textural indices from multimodal 3D brain MRI. Diagnosis and post-biopsy MR scans including T1, post-contrast T1, T2 and FLAIR images from thirty children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) were considered. The hybrid white stripe method was adapted to standardize MR intensities. Sixty textural indices were then computed for each modality in different regions of interest (ROI), including tumor and white matter (WM). Three types of intensity binning were compared [Formula: see text]: constant bin width and relative bounds; [Formula: see text] constant number of bins and relative bounds; [Formula: see text] constant number of bins and absolute bounds. The impact of the volume of the region was also tested within the WM. First, the mean Hellinger distance between patient-based intensity distributions decreased by a factor greater than 10 in WM and greater than 2.5 in gray matter after standardization.  Regarding the binning strategy, the ranking of patients was highly correlated for 188/240 features when comparing [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text], but for only 20 when comparing [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text], and nine when comparing [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, when using [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text] texture indices reflected tumor heterogeneity as assessed visually by experts. Last, 41 features presented statistically significant differences between contralateral WM regions when ROI size slightly varies across patients, and none when using ROI of the same size. For regions with similar size, 224 features were significantly different between  WM and tumor. Valuable information from texture indices can be biased by methodological choices. Recommendations are to standardize intensities in MR brain volumes, to use intensity binning with constant bin width, and to define regions with the same volumes to get reliable textural indices.","tags":[],"title":"Computation of reliable textural indices from multimodal brain MRI: suggestions based on a study of patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Apra C","Alentorn A","Mokhtari K","Kalamarides M","Sanson M"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1523743200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523743200,"objectID":"6d7c3d85e7bbff1406e680ae6bba05f5","permalink":"/publication/pazopanib/","publishdate":"2018-04-15T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pazopanib/","section":"publication","summary":"INTRODUCTION:There is currently no treatment for solitary fibrous tumors/hemangiopericytomas (SFT/H) of the central nervous system recurring after multiple surgeries and radiotherapies.

Based on serial magnetic resonance images we retrospectively evaluated the evolution of the mean tumor diameter (MTD) in 36 progressive 1p/19q-codeleted LGG treated with upfront TMZ. After TMZ onset, all but two patients (94.4%) presented a progressive MTD decrease that lasted for a median duration of 23 months (range 3-114). In 10 patients (27%) MTD regrowth occurred during TMZ treatment and in 22 patients (66%) after TMZ discontinuation. In these patients, median time to MTD regrowth after TMZ discontinuation was 12 months (range 1-88). The rate of MTD regrowth at 3 and 5 years after TMZ onset was 77 and 94%, respectively. Time to tumor progression (TTP) based on volumetric analysis was shorter than TTP based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) bidimensional criteria (23 vs. 35 months, p = 0.05) and shorter than time to next oncological treatment (23 vs. 46 months, p = 0.001). In 10 patients (27%), absence of volumetric analysis led to continue TMZ for a median of 10 cycles after MTD had started to regrow. Volumetric analysis is important to precisely assess chemotherapy efficacy in 1p/19q-codeleted LGG, identify early tumor progression and avoid futile chemotherapy continuation. In the present series, although some long-lasting volumetric responses were observed, most tumors resumed their growth within 3 years after TMZ onset.","tags":[],"title":"Long-term impact of temozolomide on 1p/19q-codeleted low-grade glioma growth kinetics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ibáñez-Juliá MJ","Pappa E","Gaymard B","Leclercq D","Hautefort C","Tilikete C","Delattre JY","Hoang-Xuan K","Psimaras D","Alentorn A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1513292400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513292400,"objectID":"35026120eba5ad1f9f414c904825c1c6","permalink":"/publication/saccadic_intrusions/","publishdate":"2017-12-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/saccadic_intrusions/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVES:Ocular flutter (OF) and opsoclonus are considered a continuum with a similar pathogenesis.

Only in recent years have molecular alterations characterizing PCNSL been thoroughly described. This opens possibilities for the use of targeted therapies. Developments in imaging and biomarkers have also great potential to help clinicians faced with diagnostic and prognostic uncertainties. RECENT FINDINGS:Several biomarkers for PCNSL, such as different microRNAs, which could be tested in cerebrospinal fluid and vitreous fluid, and IL-10, which has been shown to have excellent sensitivity and specificity in the cerebrospinal fluid, have emerged in the last years. Methotrexate-based regimens remain the gold standard first-line treatment, with recent studies looking at the best adjunctive molecules to methotrexate, including rituximab, and at the role of autologous stem cell transplantation. As mutations leading to the activation of nuclear factor-kappa-B signaling are found in most PCNSLs, with mutations of MYD88 and CD79B particularly, ibrutinib is studied as molecule of great interest and encouraging results have been found in pilot studies. There is also great interest in the immunomodulatory drugs (lenalidomide) and immunotherapy (anti-programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1).SUMMARY:Identification of molecular genetic and cytokine changes in tumor and liquid biopsies will have an increasing role in the diagnostic and follow-up of PCNSL but also in the treatment and management of the disease.","tags":[],"title":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma: time for diagnostic biomarkers and biotherapies?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tabouret E","Houillier C","Martin-Duverneuil N","Blonski M","Soussain C","Ghesquières H","Houot R","Larrieu D","Soubeyran P","Gressin R","Gyan E","Chinot O","Taillandier L","Choquet S","Alentorn A","Leclercq D","Omuro A","Tanguy ML","Hoang-Xuan K"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1489532400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1489532400,"objectID":"d3a02f899d3118f9c4512288ce358efe","permalink":"/publication/anocef_pcnsl/","publishdate":"2017-03-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/anocef_pcnsl/","section":"publication","summary":"Background:Our aim was to review MRI characteristics of patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) enrolled in a randomized phase II trial and to evaluate their potential prognostic value and patterns of relapse, including T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI abnormalities.Methods:Neuroimaging findings in 85 patients with PCNSL enrolled in a prospective trial were reviewed blinded to outcomes. MRI characteristics and responses according to International PCNSL Collaborative Group (IPCG) criteria were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results:Multivariate analysis showed that objective response at 2 months (P 11.4 cm3) enhancing tumor volume (P = .006) were associated with poor OS and PFS, respectively. Ratio of change in product of largest diameters at early MRI evaluation but not timing of complete response achievement (early vs delayed) was prognostic for OS. Sixty-nine patients relapsed. Relapse in the brain (n = 52) involved an initial enhancing site, a different site, or both in 46%, 40%, and 14% of patients, respectively. At baseline, non-enhancing T2-FLAIR hypersignal lesions distant from the enhancing tumor site were detected in 18 patients. These lesions markedly decreased (50%) in 16 patients after chemotherapy, supporting their neoplastic nature. Of these patients, 10/18 relapsed, half (n = 5) in the initially non-enhancing T2-FLAIR lesions. Conclusions:Baseline tumor size and infratentorial localization are of prognostic value in PCNSL. Our findings provide evidence that non-enhancing FLAIR abnormalities may add to overall tumor burden, suggesting that response criteria should be refined to incorporate evaluation of T2-weighted/FLAIR sequences.","tags":[],"title":"Patterns of response and relapse in primary CNS lymphomas after first-line chemotherapy: imaging analysis of the ANOCEF-GOELAMS prospective randomized trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ollier E","Mazzocco P","Ricard D","Kaloshi G","Idbaih A","Alentorn A","Psimaras D","Honnorat J","Delattre JY","Grenier E","Ducray F","Samson A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1484002800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484002800,"objectID":"40f8b9f66dc07c3f6f9dd2c17fa40d3d","permalink":"/publication/tmz_resistance/","publishdate":"2017-01-10T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tmz_resistance/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding how tumors develop resistance to chemotherapy is a major issue in oncology. When treated with temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating chemotherapy drug, most low-grade gliomas (LGG) show an initial volume decrease but this effect is rarely long lasting. In addition, it has been suggested that TMZ may drive tumor progression in a subset of patients as a result of acquired resistance. Using longitudinal tumor size measurements from 121 patients, the aim of this study was to develop a semi-mechanistic mathematical model to determine whether resistance of LGG to TMZ was more likely to result from primary and/or from chemotherapy-induced acquired resistance that may contribute to tumor progression. We applied the model to a series of patients treated upfront with TMZ (n = 109) or PCV (procarbazine, CCNU, vincristine) chemotherapy (n = 12) and used a population mixture approach to classify patients according to the mechanism of resistance most likely to explain individual tumor growth dynamics. Our modeling results predicted acquired resistance in 51% of LGG treated with TMZ. In agreement with the different biological effects of nitrosoureas, none of the patients treated with PCV were classified in the acquired resistance group. Consistent with the mutational analysis of recurrent LGG, analysis of growth dynamics using mathematical modeling suggested that in a subset of patients, TMZ might paradoxically contribute to tumor progression as a result of chemotherapy-induced resistance. Identification of patients at risk of developing acquired resistance is warranted to better define the role of TMZ in LGG.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of temozolomide resistance in low-grade gliomas using a mechanistic mathematical model.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project is funded by the La Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer - Carte d\u0026rsquo;Idendité de Tumeurs, CIT\nThis project is leaded by Dr ALENTORN and aims to analyze PCNSL using multi-comics NGS data:\n Whole-exome RNA-seq Methylation Radiomics  We will use a large cohort of PCNSL to underpin new potential therapeutic targets in this orphan disease.\n","date":1481670000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481670000,"objectID":"3cfff4648949b61715ddace86851bac7","permalink":"/project/cit/","publishdate":"2016-12-14T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/cit/","section":"project","summary":"LOC-Omics: Multi-omics analysis of PCNSL","tags":["neuro-oncology","machine-learning","radiomics","NGS"],"title":"CIT","type":"project"},{"authors":["Labussière M","Rahimian A","Giry M","Boisselier B","Schmitt Y","Polivka M","Mokhtari K","Delattre JY","Idbaih A","Labreche K","Alentorn A","Sanson M"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1465941600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465941600,"objectID":"cc960be7a35e205b70ea5db1fba80414","permalink":"/publication/17p/","publishdate":"2016-06-15T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/17p/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:The 1p19q non-codeleted gliomas with IDH mutation, defined as molecular astrocytomas, display frequent TP53 mutations and have an intermediate prognosis.

It was more frequent in astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas (98/256, 38%) than oligodendrogliomas (28/327, 8.6%; p 100 vs. 37.9 months; p = .007). These data were confirmed in an independent dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas. CONCLUSION:CNLOH 17p is a prognostic marker and further refines the molecular classification of gliomas.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:Homodisomy of chromosome 17p (CNLOH 17p) is a frequent feature in IDH-mutated 1p19q non-codeleted gliomas (group 2). It is constantly associated with TP53 mutation. It was found, within this specific molecular group of gliomas (corresponding to molecular astrocytomas), that CNLOH 17p is associated with a much better outcome and may therefore represent an additional prognostic marker to refine the prognostic classification of gliomas.","tags":[],"title":"17p Homodisomy Is Associated With Better Outcome in 1p19q Non-Codeleted and IDH-Mutated Gliomas","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.

Location and rate of growth are the most critical, followed by overall lesion size and nature, whether infiltrating or causing the displacement of neural structures, but also the presence or extent of associated pathology, including edema, hemorrhage, vascular compromise, and cerebrospinal fluid obstruction. Mechanisms of presenting symptomatology can be divided into tumor and peritumoral factors. Tumor factors include histology, for example, in that seizures are common in patients with certain low-grade gliomas. Peritumoral factors, including regional hypoxia and ionic changes in the peritumoral zone, may influence neuronal activity and extracellular glutamate may be associated with neuronal hyperexcitability. Blood-brain barrier breakdown may predispose to seizure and localized neuronal dysfunction. Finally, signs and symptoms in brain tumors can be generalized, associated with increased intracranial brain pressure, but can also be localized, based on the involvement of the major structures of the central nervous system.","tags":[],"title":"Presenting signs and symptoms in brain tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nencha U","Rahimian A","Giry M","Sechi A","Mokhtari K","Polivka M","Schmitt Y","Di Stefano AL","Alentorn A","Labussière M","Sanson M"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454626800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454626800,"objectID":"3bb598fdab8eccdd232b404f14c646f1","permalink":"/publication/tert_rs/","publishdate":"2016-02-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tert_rs/","section":"publication","summary":"TERT promoter (TERTp) mutation is the most common mutation in glioblastomas.

We explore here the interaction between these two alterations, tumor genomic profile and the impact on prognosis. The TERTp and rs2853669 statuses were determined and confronted with the outcome and molecular profile, i.e., loss of chromosome 10q, CDKN2A deletion, IDH mutation, EGFR amplification, MGMT promoter methylation. 651 glioblastomas were selected (sex ratio = 1.35, median age 60.4 years, median survival 13.5 months). The TERTp mutation found in 481 patients (74 %) was independent from rs2853669 genotypes. TERTp mutation, but not rs2853669 status, was associated with older age (61.4 vs. 52.8 years). rs2853669 status had no impact on overall survival (OS) either in mutated TERTp or wild-type TERTp. Neither rs2736100 (TERT, 5q15.33) nor rs192011116 (TERC, 3q26.2) status had any impact on survival or showed any association with a TERTp mutation. The TERTp mutation was associated with EGFR amplification chromosome 10q loss, CDKN2A deletion and IDH wt.

Over the last years, major advances have been accomplished in the molecular characterization of glioblastoma mainly thanks to high throughput molecular biology techniques. In parallel to these biological advances, pharmacological progresses have been made with the development of molecular targeted therapies or precision medicine or smart drugs targeting these molecular alterations detected in cancer cells but absent in normal cells of the body. These targeted molecular therapies, more effective and less toxic, have already revolutionized the prognosis of several systemic cancers (e.g., melanoma, lung cancer). On the basis of our knowledge of glioblastoma molecular biology, these molecular targeted therapies also appear promising in glioblastomas. Anti-angiogenic drugs are the most advanced molecular targeted therapies in their evaluation. Promising results were observed in recurrent glioblastoma patients. Other molecular targeted therapies are currently under preclinical or clinical evaluations.

The model captures potential tumor progression under chemotherapy by accounting for the emergence of tissue resistance to treatment following prolonged exposure to temozolomide. Using information on individual tumors' genetic characteristics, in addition to early tumor size measurements, the model was able to predict the duration and magnitude of response, especially in those patients in whom repeated assessment of tumor response was obtained during the first 3 months of treatment.

Indeed, glioma CpG island hypermethylated phenotype has been identified as prognostic biomarker and as a surrogate marker of IDH1/2 mutations. However, the role of DNA methylation in glioblastoma progression is unknown. We sought to analyze DNA methylation levels in paired (initial and recurrent) primary glioblastoma samples to identify candidate pathways that may prone to glioblastoma progression. We have analyzed 12 samples (5 paired samples, two of them with three surgeries) using methylation arrays. We have analyzed differential methylation at probe and at gene region level. Finally, pathway analysis has been performed using differentially methylated regions. All analysis has been performed with R and Bioconductor packages. Mean methylation level at initial sample compared to recurrence was strongly positively correlated (R(2) = 0.98). There was no differentially methylation at probe level. However, at gene level 3080 regions were differentially methylated. Interestingly, pathways analysis showed that the most differentially methylated genes are involved in cellular response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulus (GO:0036006). Methylation levels were strongly conserved when comparing initial to recurrence in primary glioblastomas. Interestingly, differentially methylated pathway analysis suggests that a modulation of methylation in immune response genes may play a role in glioblastoma progression. Further studies are needed to validate the role of methylation of glioblastoma immune response genes in tumor progression.","tags":[],"title":"Differential gene methylation in paired glioblastomas suggests a role of immune response pathways in tumor progression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruno A","Alentorn A","Daniau M","Labussière M","Rahimian A","Tabouret E","Polivka M","Jouvet A","Adam C","Figarella-Branger D","Chrétien F","Eimer S","Houillier C","Soussain C","Mokhtari K","Hoang-Xuan K"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1436047200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1436047200,"objectID":"916a1c7ded2d19c54083f6c04fe49307","permalink":"/publication/tert_pcnsl/","publishdate":"2015-07-05T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tert_pcnsl/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"TERT promoter mutations in primary central nervous system lymphoma are associated with spatial distribution in the splenium","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hottinger AF","Alentorn A","Hoang-Xuan K"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435701600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435701600,"objectID":"6fca97a57f016978da3b1ec713e60b9f","permalink":"/publication/current_onco_pcnsl/","publishdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/current_onco_pcnsl/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare tumor, and its optimal management is a matter of controversy.

Although consensus to assess MGMT promoter methylation is not reached yet, it may be useful in predicting resistance to temozolomide in elderly patients.","tags":[],"title":"Molecular profiling of gliomas: potential therapeutic implications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Touat M","Duran-Peña A","Alentorn A","Lacroix L","Massard C","Idbaih A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425164400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425164400,"objectID":"9ecd70f59a4706e1d4fda547d12492ff","permalink":"/publication/circulating_biomarkers/","publishdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/circulating_biomarkers/","section":"publication","summary":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and devastating primary malignant brain tumor in adults. The past few years have seen major progress in our understanding of the molecular basis of GBM. These advances, which have contributed to the development of novel targeted therapies, will change the paradigms in GBM therapy from disease-based to individually tailored molecular target-based treatment. No validated circulating biomarkers have yet been integrated into clinical practice for GBM. There is thus a critical need to implement minimally invasive clinical tests enabling molecular stratification and prognosis assessment, as well as the prediction and monitoring of treatment response. After examination of data from recent studies exploring several categories of tumor-associated biomarkers (circulating tumor cells, extracellular vesicles, nucleic acids and oncometabolites) identified in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid and urine, this article discusses the challenges and prospects for the development of circulating biomarkers in GBM.","tags":[],"title":"Emerging circulating biomarkers in glioblastoma: promises and challenges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["van Thuijl HF","Scheinin I","Sie D","Alentorn A","van Essen HF","Cordes M","Fleischeuer R","Gijtenbeek AM","Beute G","van den Brink WA","Meijer GA","Havenith M","Idbaih A","Hoang-Xuan K","Mokhtari K","Verhaak RG","van der Valk P","van de Wiel MA","Heimans JJ","Aronica E","Reijneveld JC","Wesseling P","Ylstra B"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1411423200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1411423200,"objectID":"13b95a4d1ebfb9a046e16f0609d2bbbb","permalink":"/publication/10q/","publishdate":"2014-09-23T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/10q/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:The disease course of patients with diffuse low-grade glioma is notoriously unpredictable. Temporal and spatially distinct samples may provide insight into the evolution of clinically relevant copy number aberrations (CNAs). The purpose of this study is to identify CNAs that are indicative of aggressive tumor behavior and can thereby complement the prognostically favorable 1p/19q co-deletion.RESULTS:Genome-wide, 50 base pair single-end sequencing was performed to detect CNAs in a clinically well-characterized cohort of 98 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded low-grade gliomas. CNAs are correlated with overall survival as an endpoint. Seventy-five additional samples from spatially distinct regions and paired recurrent tumors of the discovery cohort were analyzed to interrogate the intratumoral heterogeneity and spatial evolution. Loss of 10q25.2-qter is a frequent subclonal event and significantly correlates with an unfavorable prognosis. A significant correlation is furthermore observed in a validation set of 126 and confirmation set of 184 patients. Loss of 10q25.2-qter arises in a longitudinal manner in paired recurrent tumor specimens, whereas the prognostically favorable 1p/19q co-deletion is the only CNA that is stable across spatial regions and recurrent tumors.CONCLUSIONS:CNAs in low-grade gliomas display extensive intratumoral heterogeneity. Distal loss of 10q is a late onset event and a marker for reduced overall survival in low-grade glioma patients. Intratumoral heterogeneity and higher frequencies of distal 10q loss in recurrences suggest this event is involved in outgrowth to the recurrent tumor.","tags":[],"title":"Spatial and temporal evolution of distal 10q deletion, a prognostically unfavorable event in diffuse low-grade gliomas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cobo-Calvo Á","Alentorn A","Mañé Martínez MA","Bau L","Matas E","Bruna J","Romero-Pinel L","Martínez-Yélamos S"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1401919200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1401919200,"objectID":"05994643a6826a464780eebff97620cb","permalink":"/publication/letm/","publishdate":"2014-06-05T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/letm/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:Patients with a first episode of longitudinal extensive transverse myelopathy (LETM) were reviewed with two objectives: to evaluate the clinical spectrum of LETM and to analyze the related clinical and laboratory variables that can be used as functional prognostic markers.METHODS:A retrospective review was conducted of clinical, radiologic and biochemical data of patients admitted for LETM between 1993 and 2011.RESULTS:Our cohort included 72 patients [median age 41 years, interquartile range (IQR) 29-61.5].

The majority of studies dedicated to TP53 in gliomas were focused on mutational hotspots located in exons 5-8. Recent studies have suggested that TP53 is also mutated outside the classic mutational hotspots reported in gliomas. Therefore, we have sequenced all TP53 coding exons in a retrospective series of 61 low grade gliomas (LGG) using high throughput sequencing technology. In addition, TP53 mutational status was correlated with: (i) p53 expression, (ii) tumor type, (iii) chromosome arms 1p/19q status and (iv) clinical features of patients. The cohort included 32 oligodendrogliomas (O), 21 oligoastrocytomas (M) and 8 astrocytomas (A). TP53 mutation was detected in 52.4% (32/61) of tumors (34% of O, 71.4% of M and 75% of A). All mutations (38 mutations in 32 samples) were detected in exons 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10. Missense and non-missense mutations, including seven novel mutations, were detected in 42.6 and 9.8% of tumors respectively. TP53 mutations were almost mutually exclusive with 1p/19q co-deletion and were associated with: (i) astrocytic phenotype, (ii) younger age, (iii) p53 expression. Using a threshold of 10% p53-positive tumor cells, p53 expression is an interesting surrogate marker for missense TP53 mutations (Se = 92%; Sp = 79.4%) but not for non-missense mutation (18.4% of mutations). TP53 and p53 statuses were not prognostic in LGG. In conclusion, we have identified novel TP53 mutations in LGG. TP53 mutations outside exons 4-8 are rare. Although it remains imperfect, p53 expression with a threshold of 10% is a good surrogate marker for missense TP53 mutations and appears helpful in the setting of LGG phenotype diagnosis.","tags":[],"title":" TP53 and p53 statuses and their clinical impact in diffuse low grade gliomas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alentorn A","van Thuijl HF","Marie Y","Alshehhi H","Carpentier C","Boisselier B","Laigle-Donadey F","Mokhtari K","Scheinin I","Wesseling P","Ylstra B","Capelle L","Hoang-Xuan K","Sanson M","Delattre JY","Reijneveld JC","Idbaih A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1387062000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1387062000,"objectID":"0e729d111d5b103d07b66befb33b0602","permalink":"/publication/19q/","publishdate":"2013-12-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/19q/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:Diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGGs) form a heterogeneous subgroup of gliomas in adults. Chromosome (chr) arms 1p/19q codeletion and IDH mutation have been shown to be closely associated with oligodendroglial phenotype and better prognosis. We sought to identify relevant biomarkers in non 1p/19q codeleted LGGs.METHODS:We characterized a retrospective series of 126 LGGs using genomic arrays, microsatellite analysis, IDH sequencing, MGMT promoter methylation assay, and p53 expression analysis. RESULTS:Our study confirms that 1p/19q codeletion, mutually exclusive with p53 overexpression, was associated with: (i) better prognosis, (ii) oligodendroglial phenotype, (iii) MGMT promoter methylation, and (iv) IDH mutation. Interestingly, 1p/19q codeleted tumors occur in older patients at diagnosis. Our study shows that non 1p/19q codeleted LGGs can be divided in 5 main genomic subgroups: (i) 11p loss, (ii) 19q loss (iii) 7 gain, (iv) 19 gain, and (v) unclassified. In non 1p/19q codeleted LGGs, we demonstrated that (i) 11p loss is associated with astrocytoma phenotype and has an independent negative prognostic value, and (ii) 19q loss diminished the favorable prognostic value of IDH mutation. Our findings were validated in an independent cohort of 98 LGGs.CONCLUSION:Novel genomic entities and biomarkers have been identified in non 1p/19q codeleted LGGs. Our findings may help to stratify non 1p/19q codeleted LGGs, facilitating future individualization of treatment.

Indeed, nutritional status is a prognostic factor and a predictor of response and toxicity to treatments in breast and lung cancers for instance. To our knowledge, in patients suffering from malignant primary brain tumors, nutritional status has been poorly investigated.METHODS:Nutritional status of 26 glioblastoma patients relapsing after a first line of treatment was studied. The body mass index (BMI), the prognostic inflammatory and nutritional index (PINI) and the instant nutritional score (INS) were assessed.RESULTS:The BMI was abnormal in 12 patients, two were malnourished while 10 were overweight. The BMI was not correlated to age of patients. Overweight status did not impact patient survival but it was associated with reduced performance status. The PINI was abnormal in three patients. Finally, the INS was abnormal in 24 patients, noted 2 (n=22) or 4 (n=4).CONCLUSIONS/DISCUSSION:Our results were not in favor of systematic nutritional support in patients with recurrent glioblastoma after a first line of treatment. Being overweight does not influence prognosis but may influence performance status. Steroid therapy and chemotherapy (inducing sodium and water retention and lymphopenia) weaken the relevance of BMI and INS for nutritional assessment in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Further studies using additional nutritional tests in larger, independent and prospective cohorts of patients are warranted to obtain more details.","tags":[],"title":"Nutritional status in patients with recurrent glioblastoma","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Carte d\u0026rsquo;identité des tumeurs 2017 author: Agusti ALENTORN date: 4 octobre 2016 width: 960 height: 700 transition: linear css: rpres.css Lymphomes primitifs du SNC \nNeurologue Service de Neurologie 2 Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière  Neuro-oncologie expérimentale (INSERM U1127, CNRS UMR 7225)  Institut du Cerveau et la Moelle (ICM)    \nBiologie des LPSNC (i) Profil transcriptomique  * La biologie des LPSNC est comparée à celle des lymphome diffus à grandes cellules B - Deux groupes transcriptomiques ABC et GC - La grande majorité des LPSNC appartiennent aux ABC (plus aggressifs)\n Deckert M et al 2014 Acta Neuropath;
